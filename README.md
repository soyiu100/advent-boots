# Backstory:
I came upon this challenge through a forum site that I frequent.
Naturally, I thought of using Python, since it's the punchy language you can just chug and plug into for lightweight scripting.

But having only having used Python for punchy reasons only,
	I never thought that there wouldn't be an immediate and analogical DS to ones in Java,
	and I found myself immediately blocked on question 1.2 (lol).

Despite Java being my most "familiar" language, I actually do not have a copy of Java installed on my newer computer.
I've opted to go for a more heavy-handed, but more familiar C++.

I think C++ is overkill and definitely a lot less punchier than Python,
	but it'll do and I want to test how much I really know the sister language.
Maybe next year I'll look at Python in more depth to solve next year :)
