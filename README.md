# Advent Boots
Boilerplate for AoC (Advent of Code) in C++, using [CPR](https://docs.libcpr.org/) for communicating with the interwebs
## History
- 2022 - Didn't participate, used questions for practice.
- 2023 - Did two questions and got distracted by other life things and the cicadas. Better luck next year, I guess... 

## Instructions
IDE of choice was MSVC.  
- For CPR: `(Right-click) -> Manage NuGet Packages...`. Search for `libcpr` and install.
	- Also change `C/C++ > Language > C++ Lanaguage Standard` to `/std:c++17`.
- For boost, add boost root directory under `C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories`.
- Pass the cookie under `Configuration Properties > Debugging > Command Arguments`.

## Backstory:
I came upon this challenge through a forum site that I frequent.
Naturally, I thought of using Python, since it's the punchy language you can just chug and plug into for lightweight scripting.

But having only having used Python for punchy reasons only,
	I never thought that there wouldn't be an immediate and analogical DS to ones in Java,
	and I found myself immediately blocked on question 1.2 when practicing using 2022 questions (lol).

Despite Java being my most "familiar" language, I actually do not have a copy of Java installed on my newer computer, so
I've opted to go for a more heavy-handed, but more familiar C++.

I think C++ is overkill and definitely a lot less punchier than Python,
	but it'll do and I want to test how much I really know the sister language.
Maybe next year I'll look at Python in more depth to solve next year :)
